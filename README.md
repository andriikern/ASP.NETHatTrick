**Nota Bene.** If you find any problems with running the app, even if the app ran successfully before but then you synchronised the repository with the origin, make sure you check the *important* notes under the [*Running the App* heading](#running-the-app). If you do not find the answer to your problems, keep reading the complete text on how to run the app&mdash;maybe you missed a step. If nothing seems to solve the problem, you may [create an issue](http://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue/) or contact me personally; otherwise you could try to debug the problem yourself.

## Info

**This repository implements a simple online betting shop simulator.** The shop is implemented through all three:

1. **Database** &ndash; the simulator generates and maintains its own [database](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database/). There is no need to connect it to an existing one or creating it manually.
2. **Web API** &ndash; apart from the [database](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database/) and the front-end application, there is an [API](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_API/) layer in the middle that connects the two, simultaneously enforcing the betting shop's rules, ensuring proper data is put into the [database](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database/), and delivering the data in the correct scale (e. g. serving only the relevant events) and format ([*JSON*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON/)) to the front-end.
3. **Front-end** &ndash; the interactive web application with user-friendly interface ([graphical user interface (GUI)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface/)) that allows the user to explore the offer, place bets, deposit and withdraw money to/from their account, and check their past tickets.

The actual layered abstraction/implementation of the app is the following:

| Main Layer | Project                                                   | Layer                                                                              | Implementation                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Database   | &mdash;                                                   | [Database](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database/)                                  | [SQLite](http://sqlite.org/) (can be easily changed&mdash;see below)                                                                                                                                                     |
| Database   | [HatTrick.Models](HatTrick.Models/HatTrick.Models.csproj/) | [Database model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_model/)                      | [C#](http://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/csharp/), [.NET](http://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/)                                                                                                                  |

| Back-end   | [HatTrick.BLL](HatTrick.BLL/HatTrick.BLL.csproj)          | [BLL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_logic/#Business_logic_and_tiers/layers) | [C#](http://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/csharp/), [.NET](http://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/)                                                                                                                  |

Since [Entity Framework](http://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/ef/) is used for accessing the database, without any custom [SQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL/) code but using code-first approach, with just a few changes in the [`AppSettings`](HatTrick.API/appsettings.json) and [`Startup`](HatTrick.API/src/Startup.cs) one can migrate the app from [SQLite](http://sqlite.org/) to many others [DBMSes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database/#Database_management_system): see [here](http://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/ef/core/providers/) and [here](http://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/ef/ef6/modeling/code-first/workflows/new-database/). The app was meant to be implemented from a [DBMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database/#Database_management_system)-agnostic point of view, and to simulate scalable real-world apps where possible, therefore issues like [this one](http://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/standard/data/sqlite/async/) were ignored, but instead [asynchronous methods](http://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/csharp/asynchronous-programming/async-scenarios/) were preferred in all cases.

The resulting [database model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_model/) is visualised as a directed graph in the [*DatabaseModel.dgml* file](DatabaseModel.dgml), which was auto-generated from the [`Context` class](HatTrick.DAL/src/Context.cs) using [EF Core Power Tools](http://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/ef/core/extensions/#ef-core-power-tools).

## Running the App

**IMPORTANT.**

1. After synchronising your local repository with the origin:
    1. If the [solution](http://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/visualstudio/ide/solutions-and-projects-in-visual-studio/#solutions) was open in an [IDE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment/) before, during and after the synchronisation, it would be a good practice to close and reopen it. Just in case.
    1. Regardless, it would be the best practice to delete your local [database](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database/) before running the app again. I might have changed the [model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_model/) and/or the sample data, making the old [database](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database/) inadequate for the rest of the code and the intended app experience.
    2. If there are problems with building/running the app, try deleting the old compilation results and recompiling from scratch:
        1. terminate all app-related [processes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)/) or simply close all [command-line interpreters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface/#Command-line_interpreter)/[shells](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)/) in which the app is running,
        2. exit the [IDE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment/) in which the [solution](http://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/visualstudio/ide/solutions-and-projects-in-visual-studio/#solutions) is open,
        3. in the [C#](http://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/csharp/) projects delete the *obj/* and *bin/* directories, in the [Vue.js](https//vuejs.org/) project delete the *obj/* and *node_modules/* directories,
        4. recompile the [solution](http://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/visualstudio/ide/solutions-and-projects-in-visual-studio/#solutions).
1. If everything seems to compile but the front-end web page does not display, even after the back-end has started and having refreshed the front-end, uncomment the [line 3](HatTrick.Web/src/main.ts#L3) and comment the [line 2](HatTrick.Web/src/main.ts#L2) in [*main.ts*](HatTrick.Web/src/main.ts).

### Prerequisites

* [.NET SDK, ASP.NET Core Runtime](http://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/dotnet/): [.NET 6](http://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/dotnet/6.0/),
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/en/): v. 16.0 or higher,
* [Vue.js](https//vuejs.org/): v. 3.0 or higher,
* [Vue CLI](http://cli.vuejs.org/): v. 4.0 or higher,
* [Visual Studio](http://visualstudio.microsoft.com/): [Visual Studio 2022](http://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/visualstudio/releases/2022/release-notes/), maybe [Visual Studio 2019](http://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes/) (not tested), or higher &ndash; optional, but recommended,
    * [Chrome](http://google.com/chrome/) or [Edge](http://microsoft.com/en-gb/edge/) &ndash; if using [Edge](http://microsoft.com/en-gb/edge/), [`launch`](HatTrick.Web/.vscode/launch.json) should be updated.

I am not sure which are the minimal versions of [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/en/) and [Vue CLI](http://cli.vuejs.org/) required for the code to be successfully compiled and run. Actually, maybe [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/en/) alone is sufficient for simply running the already set up [HatTrick.Web](HatTrick.Web/HatTrick.Web.esproj). Otherwise, the versions mentioned above may in fact be insufficient, as the code was built on versions higher than the ones listed.

### Universal Guidelines

First, [clone the repo](http://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository/). Once the code is available locally, **the app must be run in development mode**&mdash;this refers to the [HatTrick.API](HatTrick.API/HatTrick.API.csproj) and [HatTrick.Web](HatTrick.Web/HatTrick.Web.esproj) projects. It cannot run in production mode because the [connection string](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_string/) is currently set only in the [development `AppSettings`](HatTrick.API/appsettings.Development.json), and the [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org/) [proxy server](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server/) is set only for the [`devServer.proxy`](http://cli.vuejs.org/config/#devserver-proxy) in [`vue.config`](HatTrick.Web/vue.config.js). See below how to achieve running in development mode.

### Running Using [Visual Studio](http://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

The application is implemented as a [Visual Studio Solution](http://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/visualstudio/ide/solutions-and-projects-in-visual-studio/#solutions). The simplest way to run the app is to open the [HatTrick.sln solution](HatTrick.sln) in [Visual Studio](http://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), and run the [HatTrick.API](HatTrick.API/HatTrick.API.csproj) and [HatTrick.Web](HatTrick.Web/HatTrick.Web.esproj) projects in parallel: see [here](http://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/visualstudio/javascript/tutorial-asp-net-core-with-vue/#set-the-startup-project) and [here](http://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/visualstudio/javascript/tutorial-asp-net-core-with-vue/#start-the-project). By default, the app will run in development mode, but this can be changed, as explained [here](http://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/aspnet/core/fundamentals/environments/#development-and-launchsettingsjson) and [here](http://cli.vuejs.org/guide/mode-and-env.html#modes-and-environment-variables).

### Running Manually

Again, the [HatTrick.API](HatTrick.API/HatTrick.API.csproj) and [HatTrick.Web](HatTrick.Web/HatTrick.Web.esproj) projects must be run in parallel. To run the former in development mode, see [here](http://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/aspnet/core/fundamentals/environments/#development-and-launchsettingsjson) and [here](http://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/aspnet/core/fundamentals/environments/#set-environment-on-the-command-line); note that the `Development` environment is already defined in the [`launchSettings`](HatTrick.API/Properties/launchSettings.json). To run the latter in development mode, see [here](http://cli.vuejs.org/guide/mode-and-env.html); more about running the [HatTrick.Web](HatTrick.Web/HatTrick.Web.esproj) is available in its own [`README`](HatTrick.Web/README.md).

## Remarks

Obviously, this is a simulator. What ever the user *does* with the *money* using the app, no real-world transactions take place in the background. Also, although the original (non-promoted) offer, which is currently available through sample data, was copied from one Croatian betting provider at one specific point in time, the coefficients do not necessarily reflect competitors' potential to accomplish the favourable outcomes.

However, there are some more important implications, regarding the architecture of the solution at hand:

1. All [web API](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_API/) endpoints allow passing a time point, either for searching the database (e. g. not to display past events) or for specifying when a certain user-initiated action was done. Also, the front-end maintains its own hard-coded fixed time-point at which all actions are *done*, and it passes it in all communication with the back-end. In reality, the server would take care of recording time, and it would not expose any functionality for manipulating it. This was done mainly to make sure the offer never expires on the front-end.
    * **IMPORTANT.** When testing the [web API](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_API/), make sure you pass a time-point no earlier than the 1<sup>st</sup> of January, 2023, and no later than the 8<sup>th</sup> of February, 2023. If no time-point is passed, or a too early or a too late one is passed, the offer might seem empty, even though there are clearly some data in the database.
2. No authentication is implemented in the app. The database allows having multiple users, each ticket and transaction must be related to a registered active user (at the time), and the front-end keeps a hard-coded user id which it then uses for communicating with the back-end. On the other hand, the back-end accepts the id as any other parameter, meaning that every one could send requests to the back-end on behalf of any one else, simply by passing the other user's id. If the requests were otherwise valid, the back-end would accept them&mdash;which is a major vulnerability, especially when dealing with financial transactions.
3. The code is far from ideal. First of all, this was my first serious experience with [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org/), and therefore I am probably not even aware of all the downsides of my solution there. Also, regarding the front-end, the web design could be much better, but I mostly focused on the business logic in the app, and merely made a simple [Bootstrap-powered](http://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/) web page for the highest layer. Second of all, some [C#](http://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/csharp/) classes in the back-end could probably be split into smaller classes, using a higher level of abstraction, but this is something one would do in a professional environment, for a production-quality code, having serious resources available (e. g. time, money, people&hellip;).
4. The [database model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_model7) is very simplified and exposes only the entities and properties needed for the app. In real life, there is some additional information that would be associated with the entities used by the app:
    * value segmentation of users &ndash; as the segmentation is needed only for internal business processes, it is irrelevant for a simulator like this one,
    * stake factor grading of users &ndash; similar to the previous, only it could be used to further limit the maximal amount to bet, which adds no value to the simulator,
    * entities for tournaments, competitors, and maybe even locations &ndash; sure, the tournaments table could be utilised for this app to present the events in the offer groupped by tournaments, but, for it to make sense, more events should be present in the sample data; for other tables I do not see a signifficant value they would add to the app if present,
    * keeping track of rescheduled events and having the rescheduled events reference the original events &ndash; again, I only see the value added by this in internal business processes, such as when analysing how many different events were offered during a certain period (month, year, &c.).
5. Although the [database model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_model/) is simplified, the sample data contains some unused entries which fit into the model, but utilising them would make the simulator much more complex than it is (e. g. live fixtures or *cashed out* ticket status).
6. The offer could be a little more diverse. Primarily, there are only two types of markets, and one of them is available only for a single event. However, the offer is here just to present the data in the database and to allow the user to place a bet. Extending the offer would make the simulator seem more realistic, but no additional functionality would be added to the simulator. As one can easily copy the offer from an existing betting provider, without much creativity, I decided not to pursue this goal, but to focus more on the business logic and the design.
7. The app includes some functionality to display tickets differently depending on their status and resolution (cash-out/win/lose). However, to see this, the sample data should be extended. I might add additional data to the database, but probably will not.
